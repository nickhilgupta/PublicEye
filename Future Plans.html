      <p>
          This project is incredibly close to being done. With that said, there are a few things that we think should be optimized.
      </p>
        <ul>
            <li>An audio response from the device that indicates the beginning and end of recording to make the experience more intuitive.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>A basic version of this was implemented but never seen all the way through.
                    The idea was to have a noise that goes up in pitch when the recording starts, and one that goes down in pitch when the recording ends</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Better eye-recognition</li>
            <ul>
                <li>The AI needs to be trained further. We want to make sure we aren't recording anything that isn't an eyeball</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Including auto-focus</li>
            <ul>
                <li>The camera does not focus automatically very well, so there should be some optimization here.
                    Also it would be nice to have some sort of filter that reduces the glare of glasses so users don't need
                    to take off their glasses
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Better housing for all sensors and wiring</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Everything is still exposed so we need to make sure the wires are safe from wild animals
                    and the equiptment is safe from harsh weather.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Current setup is quite messy</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Just try to make it look pretty</li>
            </ul>
