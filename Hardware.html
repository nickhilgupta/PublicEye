        As mentioned before, a great deal of hardware has already been purchased for this project. This should be
        sufficient to get the project up and running. Here is a short list of the hardware devices at hand:

        <ul>
          <li>Ultrasonic Sensor</li>
          <ul>
              <li>USB-ProxSonar-EZT M Series</li>
              <li>This sensor is used for checking to find out whether somone has approached the prototype and is
                  waiting for their eye to be scanned</li>
          </ul>
          <li>xiQ Industrial Camera</li>
          <ul>
              <li>Donated to the project not from the budget. This is a very high quality camera and can record 1440p
                  video at 90FPS.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Custom Computer</li>
          <ul>
              <li>This computer was intentionally built to be quite powerful. It was used to train the neural network
                  to
                  classify images as eye or not-eye. It also holds a copy of all the code and is one of the most
                  important
                  parts of this project. Here are the computer specification: </li>
              <ul>
                  <li>CPU: i3-8100 Quad Core</li>
                  <li>GPU: GTX 1050</li>
                  <li>Memory: 16GB RAM</li>
                  <li>Storage 1: 156GB m.2 SSD</li>
                  <li>Storage 2: 2TB HDD</li>
              </ul>
          </ul>
          <li>Mobile UDOO</li>
          <ul>
              <li>This is a small portable and low-powered computer</li>
              <li>It is used to keep a virtual library of the recordings</li>
              <li>The goal is to have the UDOO connect up to the main prototype and have everything run off it</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Flexible LED Strip + Relay</li>
          <ul>
              <li>This is the light strip the inside of the camera housing</li>
              <li>Relay controls power to the LED such that itâ€™s only on when recording</li>
              <li>This might need to be configured so that the brightness of the LEDs can be reduced</li>
          </ul>
      </ul>
